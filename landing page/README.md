# BSV Academy

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology and can be quite complex; for most people, it’s a steep learning curve - but it doesn’t have to be. As part of the Bitcoin Association, BSV Academy has curated a range of educational information and resources to establish a curriculum, from which training modules and courses have been developed to best serve the needs of the Bitcoin SV community.

Our goal is to:

* &#x20;Strengthen and expand existing sources.
* Grow the overall talent pool and skills base for Bitcoin.
* Offer training appropriate for all skill levels, from introductory Bitcoin blockchain courses through to expert-level material.
* Make it easier to on-board staff for businesses, enterprise and all other industry participants.
* Reinforce blockchain development expertise as a unique and self-regulating profession.

Our courses are broken up into four key streams:

* Bitcoin Essentials
* Bitcoin Theory
* Bitcoin Development
* Bitcoin Infrastructure

### Bitcoin Essentials

Bitcoin Essentials will give students new to Bitcoin a more introductory perspective on some of the design features, the application of Bitcoin to legacy enterprise and three bridging courses for students to better understand some of the computer science techniques deployed in the system.

#### Bitcoin Basics: Protocol and Design

{% endcontent-ref %}

Bitcoin Basics: Protocol and Design will introduce students to the Bitcoin Ledger, Coins and Transactions and a high level overview of the general theory behind the system.

#### Bitcoin Enterprise

{% endcontent-ref %}

Introduction to Bitcoin Enterprise focuses on the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin to radically transform many aspects of legacy enterprise.&#x20;

#### Bitcoin Primitives

[Hash Functions](https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/HeYD5HNM81vcf8bAxUyk/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/ASQTX8ipRvaiNTfPRslO/" %}
[Merkle Trees](https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/ASQTX8ipRvaiNTfPRslO/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/2YO1nWHXVxs63Boja1m7/" %}
[Digital Signatures](https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/2YO1nWHXVxs63Boja1m7/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Bitcoin Primitives courses  are to be considered akin to bridging courses for students without a formal background in computer science so that they may fully understand some techniques from the field which have been deployed in Bitcoin. These three primitives courses cover Hash Functions, Merkle Trees and Digital Signatures.

### Bitcoin Theory

[Bitcoin Theory](https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/x45iUI3H5dl5Am05Uwvd/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Bitcoin Theory stream starts by taking students through the Bitcoin Whitepaper line by line and elaborating on the deeper meanings to ensure a thorough understanding of the Bitcoin system. This course should be considered as a compulsory prerequisite for all deeper study of the Bitcoin protocol as it ensures that everyone who passes the course will have a standardised understanding of the Whitepaper as the technical manifesto of the Bitcoin protocol.

### Bitcoin Development

[Bitcoin Development](https://app.gitbook.com/o/XRhTy6ZTa7k6aGkXcfRv/s/ae4ORq1zyyFXkx0imS1x/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Bitcoin Development stream starts with the Introduction to Bitcoin Development which is currently being reworked to reflect the state of the art approach to development and future proof it as a tool agnostic framework. The reworked course will equip students with the proper conceptualisation and approach to developing with Bitcoin such that whatever you build can be sure to scale and interoperate with other services in the ecosystem.

{% embed url="https://bsvblockchain.gitbook.io/introduction-to-bitcoin-script/WZLB4WdNwXtfIaMPivj5/" %}

Introduction to Bitcoin Script provides a detailed exploration of the Forth-based scripting language used in the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (Bitcoin VM) during transaction validation. This course guides learners through the functional groups of opcodes in the language, demonstrating how to construct basic script templates and simulate recursive-like behaviors using innovative techniques such as the OP\_PUSHTX methodology.

### Bitcoin Infrastructure

{% endcontent-ref %}

The Bitcoin Infrastructure stream starts with the Introduction to Bitcoin Infrastructure which will be fundamental foundational knowledge for anyone seeking to operate in bitcoin mining or leveraging the network capabilities of Bitcoin to serve as information technology infrastructure. The course takes students through the bitcoin protocol rules to ensure they understand which parameters of the node client they can configure and which are immutable consensus rules that need to be upheld to allow you to operate within the small world network of miners.&#x20;
